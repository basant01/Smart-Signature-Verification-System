# Smart-Signature-Verification-System

A Web App uisng Django to recognize two signature using image processing.The process involves taking two signature made by the same individual .The objective of signature verification systems is to discriminate if a given signature is genuine (produced by the claimed individual), or a forgery (produced by an impostor). 

***WEB APP FRONT END LOOK*** where user can upload two images of signature of same individual to be compared

***User will Upload Images through Web App***

***After Uploading the image so result is being processed so page will show a response that page is loading***
